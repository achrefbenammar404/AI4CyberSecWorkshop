# AI4CyberSecWorkshop

Welcome to the **AI in Cybersecurity Workshop** repository! This workshop was organized in collaboration with **IEEE ENICarthage University** to introduce participants to the role of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** in **Cybersecurity**. This repository contains the materials, code, datasets, and presentation slides used during the workshop.

## Workshop Overview

The **AI in Cybersecurity Workshop** is designed to help participants understand how AI can be leveraged to protect systems from cyber threats. The workshop focuses on two key cybersecurity problems:
1. **Malware Detection**: Using AI to detect malicious software.
2. **Time to Compromise (TTC) Prediction**: Predicting the time it takes for an attacker to breach a system based on system vulnerabilities.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
- Understanding classification and regression problems.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models.
- AI-driven approaches for threat detection and prediction.
- Hands-on experience with real-world cybersecurity datasets.

### Slides
- The **Slides** folder contains the workshop presentation slides: 
  - [AI in Cybersecurity Slides](./Slides/AI_in_Cybersecurity_Slides.pdf)

### src
- The **src** directory contains the **Jupyter notebooks** and **datasets** used for the hands-on exercises:
  - **Malware Detection**: The `Malware_Detection.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the use of machine learning models to detect malicious software. It uses the `malware_detection_dataset.csv` dataset.
  - **Time to Compromise (TTC) Prediction**: The `Time_to_Compromise.ipynb` notebook focuses on predicting the time it takes for an attacker to compromise a system using regression models. It uses the `time_to_compromise_dataset.csv` dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with the workshop materials, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/achrefbenammar404/AI4CyberSecWorkshop.git
cd AI4CyberSecWorkshop
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

```bash
# For Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv venv

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# For Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Explore the Notebooks

To follow the hands-on exercises, open the Jupyter notebooks in the `src/` directory.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this workshop are synthetic datasets created for educational purposes:
1. **malware_detection_dataset.csv**: Contains labeled data for malware detection tasks.
2. **time_to_compromise_dataset.csv**: Contains data for predicting the time to compromise based on system and network vulnerabilities.

Both datasets are located in the `src/data/` folder.

---

## Workshop Agenda

1. **Introduction to AI and Cybersecurity**:
   - Overview of how AI can enhance cybersecurity and common AI techniques.
   
2. **Supervised Learning in Cybersecurity**:
   - Explanation of classification (malware detection) and regression (time to compromise prediction).
   
3. **Malware Detection**:
   - Using machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to classify malicious software.

4. **Time to Compromise Prediction**:
   - Building regression models to predict how quickly a system can be compromised based on vulnerabilities and system configurations.
